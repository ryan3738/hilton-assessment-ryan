## Hilton Dev Assessment

For this code assessment, we expect you to make the changes listed in the `Deliverables` sections and then email us the link to your codesandbox instance that has your changes. (As soon as you make a change and save it, it will fork this project and create a unique url for you).

## Setup

You need to sign up for an OpenWeather API key. Instructions are here: https://openweathermap.org/appid

[ ] After you get your API, add that as API_KEY in city-weather.tsx

## Mock bug report

Steps to reproduce:

1. Type a valid US city in the "Weather Search" box
1. Press {enter}

Expected results
User should see the current weather results for that city

Actual Results:
App crashes

## Deliverable 1:

1. Fix the bug
   - Treating this like a bug ticket, identify the bug in the application and provide a fix.
2. Talk about your changes
   - Write a short description about what was the underlying cause of the bug and how you fixed it

## Deliverable 2:

1. Create a city-weather-refactor.tsx file, in which you refactor the city-weather component to use react hooks rather than React.Component. Incorporate the following:

   1. Match the design
      - A designer has provided a comp on how this app should look (see design.png)
        - To match the design you may need to use different fields that are retuned from teh openweathermap API. For example, the weather condition three digit code can be [mapped to the icons here](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)
      - Tailwindcss is installed and configured for you
   2. Improve web accessibility
      - Ensure that clicking on the label "Weather Search" puts focus into the text-input.
      - Make sure any loading states are correctly announced to a screen reader
   3. Make the tests better
      - There was a test written for this feature but it clearly didn't catch the bug, make the test better (you can open a new terminal in the bottom right of code sandbox and `yarn test`)

2. Talk about your changes
   - For the refactor and other accompanying tasks, include any other thoughts, assumptions, or known compromises in how you approached the work.
